## 10/9/2025 - Design specifications / Early schematic work.  

Alrighty! Highway 2.0 I guess.

I'm going to try and follow a similar journal format to my highway projects, so we may as well get into it.

# Euclidean VCA

The basic concept behind this effect pedal is pretty much completely stolen from a digital plugin called [HY-ESG](https://bpb.gumroad.com/l/hy-esg/HYESGFREE).

![HY-ESG UI](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTE3MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--28f3ae68b373cba9267337b02d5ee28dd5ece970/image.png)

This effect is a super versatile and (imo) really cool effect. I use it extensively in my projects and I think it would be really cool to have an effect like it that I can use without having my laptop and a bunch of additional latency on stage. 

In summary, what the effect actually does is modulate the *volume* of the input based on a *euclidean sequencer.* 

## Sequencer

I think the best way to show how this works is by just showing it, so here's a quick demo.

![HY-ESG Sequencer demo](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTE3MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a3ac19ee0834e37bc5d7d4e5310b8558f2a1a7d3/2025-10-09%2020-21-08.gif)

When the sequencer goes onto a bright segment, the volume turns on, and when it goes dark, it turns off. 
The steps parameter changes the number of steps in a cycle, and the pulse parameter changes how many are active per cycle. Rotate just offsets it. How the pulses are distributed in the cycle is the entire subject matter of euclidean sequencers, and it is (practically) impossible to do with an analog circuit, so for this I am going to use a microcontroller. 

## Envelope

Alright, so the actual sequencer part is sorted. Next up, the envelope generator. Ideally, we could just output a voltage from the MCU which controlled a little amplifier to change the volume of the instrument smoothly, rising up and down without massive sharp edges (configurable by the user of course, this being the basis of an adsr envelope). Unfortunately, the microcontrollers I am considering using do not have true analog output, instead sending a pwm signal. This might not be a problem, but I have a bad feeling about it, so instead I'm simply going to output digital high on a pulse, and digital low on a gap. This will then be the input into an analog envelope generator, which transforms the signal as per the example below. 

![ar-envelope](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTE3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eecd47fffec6684738e22715470256f5e1a2312d/ar-envelope.png)
*This is actually an ar (attack - release) envelope, which is probably what I'll use in the design due to complexity, and not really needing delay and sustain.*

This then just needs to run into a VCA to control the actual volume of the instrument. 

## The VCA

There are a couple circuits online, but the one I'm most familiar with is a Long-Tailed-Pair VCA. The main downside is it requires a couple closely matched resistors and transistors, but with a bit of manual adjustment and gluing the transistors together for heat it should be ok. The other problem is that the circuit I've currently got requires a dual rail power supply, and as I want this to stick to the defacto standard for pedals, I'll only have 0v and 9v. The obvious solution here is to use a virtual ground at 4.5v, and apply a dc bias to the input signal and then filter it out at the end. This unfortunately does mean I need to do a bit of a redesign on the VCA circuit, so we'll see how that goes. 

Anyways, that'll do for today. Tomorrow I'm going to work on getting a model of the circuit simulated so I can finalise the design and move onto the schematic and pcb. Following that, case and art design as well as figuring out what knobs and dials I need.

Tschuss!  

## 10/13/2025 - Designed Circuit  

## Circuit Design

Time to start the circuit design.
For this, I'm going to begin with what I think is the simplest part, the envelope generator.

![ar-envelope](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--af28c3a3583252817d1480304afe06a87a692e2f/ar-envelope.png)

Even just looking at the desired change, it seems obvious that the solution for this will be some kind of capacitor based circuit, and thats absolutely correct.

A really interesting way to view this problem is using summed sines. A square wave is (theoretically) the sum of an infinite number of sine waves, as shown below.

![Sum Of sines](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTM0MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ce86a057a8f66705753a6cd568b9553847a73fb8/2025-10-10%2B17-23-11.gif)

Each sine wave added has to also increase in frequency, and as we remove the higher frequency sine waves, it looks less and less like a square wave and more like a curved sine wave. So, given our square electrical signal, which we can consider to be composed of near infinitely many sine waves, if we can find a way to filter out the higher frequency sine waves, we will be left with just the low frequency ones, which look far more like what we want than just a square wave. 

Handily, there is a super simple circuit which can do this for us. A low pass filter.

[![Low pass filter circuit](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTM0NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b27fe7c31f1159942e7780ecf2b50728838247ff/image.png)](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html?ctz=CQAgjCAMB0l3BWEA2AnNAzAFi2DCxItsxkkFIQliqBTAWjDACgAlELOEAJgHZuQGZAA4e-KDyo9oSbjIkwEzAMYdkWMQKzrB3ShoSx4xk5DANeHaKhuoEvYQ+6dUkATDgQYLAOZqNGHr+gkIKzADuwXwCBALRUMx6lrGaVMiU8RoA8gCuAC4ADvnMAE5R4pwZ4pSE8MwA9hwoGjXc3KgQSB6eEu4JQA![image.png](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg3NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fa73637922d3d022117bb2187254dcadd9b8b2bb/image.png)
)

Using this incredibly simple setup, just a resistor and a capacitor, we can filter out a reasonable accurate range of frequencies just by changing the values of R1 and C1 through the simple formula:
Fc = 1 ÷ (2π[R1][C1])

This also means that by changing the value of R1, via a potentiometer, we can control the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter and thus how sharp or round the envelope output is. 

So a very basic A/R envelope might look something like this:
[![Basic Attack / release envelope generator](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTM0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0daa12a44648894530ba29bb5cb835aefb0c4be4/image.png)](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html?ctz=CQAgjCAMB0l3BWcB2AzNALAJgQrWwBOPDSANlRAUiqpoQFMBaMMAKAGMQyAOHkVFhq9+qHhhATGTZANjJsGXmUKFIWFWCxRYkCJDYBzbnwHiT-UjWtsAStywTB9QtudQQ2pFmjffHmAQ2AHcLASEQZAj3AyFZKJp3ZF5wmgkAeQBXABcABxy2AA9uagExbjInDAgJVhBbdmKyBFFcbiiBFslwCABhdjAFBycIkVSPMHg4HVRqshAAQQB6WxCS+dRICWb5rA6DUJ3PDrG97QOws7CYtgB7bsqPUlVaGHgiBFQtJBptc7YgA)
$^*You can click on the image to test the circuit yourself*$

The only problem is that when you change the value of the potentiometer, both the time of the attack and release change simultaneously. Instead what we want is to make individually adjustable attack and release times. 

[![Adjustable Attack / Release](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg3MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2f67a91ca3191bae2abe0ceb5941585014e38891/image.png)](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html?ctz=CQAgjCAMB0l3BWEA2AnNAzAFi2DCxItsxkkFIQliqBTAWjDACgAlEAJkgA5OB2DuD7J+gyoKQdok6VCjTmAd049RnDljWQl6zRwG7D25Rw1rTmjFyg6LIK+IQiHNsHz1P71ly8qF4lDAcyGastADOAJbhAC4AhgB2AMa0zG4eInYudn4BgdBg3A55JRggYVGxiSm2ZnYcnjm23LwYRJwtHbzGXb3ZnT39rd7WPRydXLzjvGCoYs0zc15+S4PWs4LZZmuUPhjOozpblvtGzAAm9qdZ3Hp1IOe0AGZxAK4ANjEX9rfLVwfiB7PN6fI6-Oy4TLbMGWayQv49eEueH6ebKFFmFEGRGkNRYZB6bHMJIgfGEwRkv6aBCwEp0sAMPicWDcVCQQptHAIPgIXmaGBwCDaADmpIJVPFGFOgR0lNRVDAgnl2i4TIISoMTnEBk0AHlXjEAA4G5gAe04InFlCwkFQqCo8gCqGETgacjENiAA)

When we charge up the capacitor, current flows through the top potentiometer and diode, and when releasing the charge, it flows backwards through the bottom diode and potentiometer. So now we have an effectively complete A/R envelope.

## Amplifier

I'm not going to go into too much detail for the amplifier circuit, but it follows a very standard long tailed pair design, which Moritz Klein has a great video explaining. 

I had to make several changes to the circuit as well, because the design shown in the video used a dual supply rail of -12v, 0v, and 12v. Unfortunately the entire supply range I have available is 0v-9v, so I needed to do something a bit different.

The ac signal input oscillates around ground with an amplitude of around 40-50 mV. Because there is an op amp in the circuit, with a VSS of gnd, all signals that go below ground will just be clipped to ground. Instead what we can do is offset the signal by 4.5v, a new virtual ground. Then we can bias all of our transistors as well, and when we amplify it we have a decent amount of headroom. After this we can just use a basic capacitor to filter out the dc offset. 

[![Long tailed pair amplifier](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7ae8d0d853dd0819ff97782a7a7ec4bbb568fb45/image.png)](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html?ctz=CQAgjCAMB0l5YCsA2ATIkBmAHK6B2NRXMAFkwE4LJlSREL6Rz6BTAWjDACgAnEVJGzgwqAUPAUxkcPEh8skOlzGYlk6bPjcw+OoOErFy0eHrwo0DACVWAZwCWdgC4BDAHYBjVt0H4BKCAUyAEhpMJ0AGoAwtHcAO7GGknoIfKJBsmZqKh06eLCOXSkcAK5UAkpgSUyqRUZEkUFAvjS3M7ghALYhY09UGbspLBgFPhq2NTYYLQMIEMjyBTYiIg5OJg5-mAWACasAGauAK4ANs7cm2YyYBxgmAM3Vo8CZhAyN+1YmCGo-Wr6fo3ebDBDBbBLRCYEqTBAgxYUciQShrMhoRSlHiJAGhFKterfX7-ZCFIEKH6k4QUrAkgY7OC+SD+aks2k1ZggSIAcQAcgARSo4oXqTBrAlCsV1UVtBpU9SZaUEhWSwKK+R+cCkOjUsjFUpRXkC-i67qGLU04Q3bSJE1-QxdO0VY3mx20U0DHJyBTsprhWrlK3afg+6rYWqBQMM-hSlVhK6R+SeEBux0zd10RAcfzDVAbVCtbCkYiES2wOHyY1EwwhakJ9VM8A12lp9l0Q3cayN93sK6OmT6UowZEvGCIDvJiMTkI9zT9mSMD6WMeJZCT1c1tq7KdYMStGS9kD7I5nC6JPc7kD4QsXxOX69XK90MMcsBluTvuS3dj+bDQUiENRdEQJRch6NIy3eaAeEERhzwfQQQGfPI3yUH8-wAhB8GA0hQIhSw4HecBKkfRCZHPZ98nImR11IioNRo58aKMNt+W4ABzS8EOfc9gkeYj713a8PkZfwSLI68Zw5GI4g1QtLUQ8J5iuKJYgUOSBnUt1IzUxS3XU0R5Ppesf0UgyFOrfsQHbRJ9L+IJTDM-JNLoChTC07hXHssRFKobzhGEBctDkZhoFzaYoVICgflaJZilCnAkCELC-GQTAICMhlEl85gAqkPisry+dTGErLiq8m8RKCQqqrESSDVY4NnzqP1CQ9QRtA1FrMB+HL9zZTlrN63FEFMOp8hapo1kKANKhGsQ6im3F5E8xbcmoxoSkQoI6Q-RDYGwNQ9CZURNhoPahEOsgoSUVz8EYDL8mQDb1vtNIFCe176Ds3Q0jKL1EkWn6vumvJKg+gRNtoWpNtvKGIeo-o1o5PBgI-NHSCzEKwrAaZ8C4CE9CEiCnWTRHIf+BC60qkkqQQmmsDFFiBRXMmyIQpGK046HxP0GGgt8Lg715mR1I514w0xRlGFcsQ3Rl8A7OQuR-yxhLgOwZKmVSyCCLpbgAA95lQRhBHSlhBGKCGQAAGQAe3cNiAB07AAFVcBxTlYXZnYABXd3gDe3UYHiwm5eN5kA+WiZ2ADEPecVgA8N2YQRFyAMB7bMrZ9234kT2P48ThwHcDg6IEzoJSh7S3ym5VjDaBuasE2kaMAj6J7ecXhbdOZ3Ih7tw2J8XR5uqXtQ0XfwMAwRdR05AfXCH7hbdJrabhyVz8N1odt6wARAuNrBl+YYE5yocR8PQMxvP3bggA)

## Complete Circuit

Combining these two parts together with a bit of buffering and the power circuitry, we get the (near) complete circuit.

[![Complete circuit](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg3NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a75028412c796e58c23d1f3c403e1b808746fa77/image.png)](https://tinyurl.com/238v266v)

This is still missing the mcu to generate the actual sequence data, but it seems to be functional aside from this from my testing.

So that makes this stage of design effectively complete. I'm currently breadboarding it to check that it does work in reality, and once that's done I'll make some tweaks and start on the pcb design.

  

## 10/18/2025 7 PM - Layout Schematic + Routed PCB  

Today I quickly laid out the schematic, which consisted of just effectively copying the circuit sim.
I did have to spec some parts like the transistors, but I mostly just tried to stick to bits I had laying around. 

Heres the completed schematic:
![Schematic](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjkxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9b87529c0750eed4083df6568a569007c772afc0/Screenshot%202025-10-18%20172440.png)

I did also chuck in the mcu and surrounding circuitry, for which I chose an arduino nano, again because I have one lying around. I was going to use an attiny chip, but lack of pins and i2c support for the display convinced me otherwise. I've got three rotary encoders to control pulse, step and speed. The Arduino and all the encoders aren't mounted on the board just to save space.

Next I laid out all the components on the pcb, which was a bit of a challenge, but after a couple attempts I settled on this layout:
![Component Layout](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjkxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ea7f46355bbe99c78f688a42f0a43b1f3ae7c4e8/Screenshot%202025-10-18%20191505.png)

And after that, I quickly routed the pcb, and ended up with an almost finished product!
![Routed](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjkxNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2db2d9a605854d41e7eb7998d19bfff252de635d/Screenshot%202025-10-18%20193149.png)
  

## 10/18/2025 9 PM - Case Design  

Onto the next logical step!
Case design.

I designed the PCB to fit within a standard 1590b guitar pedal case, and after a bunch of consideration I've decided that I'd like to go with a metal bottom enclosure with a wooden top case. 

This is because plastic is simply not durable enough for a guitar pedal, excluding longer chain polymers like HDPE or PVC, which are simply not feasible to have produced. In contrast, it's reasonably easy to find metal cases online for pretty cheap, so theres really no detriment.

![1590b case](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjkxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--705b9ca7dd6b273698c7623f2cb31136cea00589/image.png)

Instead of a metal top plate, however, I've decided to go with a laser cut wooden case. This is mainly because this pedal includes an led matrix, and I feel like routing out a pretty large rectangle from solid aluminium would be a bit beyond my capabilities. My school also has a laser cutter that I can use for cutting and engraving, which should be good for the pedal design (aesthetics matter ❤️).

With that out of the way, I booted up fusion and started the design.
![case top](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjkyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f8017d772d8a5c3faf470c19362f077b07ab33aa/image.png)

This plate was super simple, but lots of double checking spacing between knobs to make sure I had enough space. I'm pretty sure it all fits, but I'll make sure to double check before cutting the holes.
Plate is 2mm ply, and it is going to be engraved for knob labels and some designs as well.  

## 10/23/2025 1 PM - Redid the pcb + case  

After showing this project to my friend who builds pedals a decent amount, he pointed out some very glaring design flaws.

First of all, there was no space for ports, and I would likely not be able to fit everything in the case. Thats actually pretty much the main problem lol...

## The Redesign
I eventually decided to move to a 1590BB case rather than a 1590A case, just a bit bigger and it would allow me to add a tap tempo button :)

Here's the sizes for comparison:
![1590a vs 1590bb enclosure sizes](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU4NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--60166305b4e20c2e93a7c171a4252a14b8d3ca6d/image.png)

Not only is it a bit wider, but it's also significantly deeper, which should help with fitting all the parts.

After this, I laid out all the knob locations and the led matrix, and was left with a bit of a problem.
![Pcb Layout](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1ff4151376349b02ec59f410af9904582ccc506b/Screenshot%202025-10-22%20183931.png)
Yeah.. no way I was fitting all of those components on the pcb. I had a couple options here:
- Bigger Case
- No LED Matrix
- No Tap Tempo button
I really didn't want any of these, so I went with the secret fourth option: Make all the small components smd and have it assembled by jlcpcb.

I also decided to put the led matrix and max7219 chip on the pcb rather than on a seperate board, so that I could also fit the arduino on the pcb.
My final component layout looked like this:
![component layout](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU4NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c743bae680ef6f78db696b0f9dd0afaf5baedcfd/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20122555.png)

Not too shabby!
Then routing:
![Routed board](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU4OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b34229574402873f26dddd3d0e392ac791ae2633/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20125223.png)

Then realizing the arduino is on the wrong side of the board so rerouting half of it:
![Re-routed board](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU4OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e6d2d7c7de6c6347aa25b656f0b5a09cda300a60/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20132156.png)

And that's the new design done!

I quickly chucked everything in 3d to double check all the sizes in the actual enclosure:
![3d Board top](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU5MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4e65fb4d67a671fb602df92715af1fc3cb0010e3/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20132214.png)
![3d board bottom](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7c73c51321a1b3aef50d0f58b69c91fa3929823a/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20132228.png)
![board in case](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU5MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0600b36802fc671ec819e6666b7fa6a36f2a7836/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20133725.png)

And its all looking pretty decent! Next up is to get a quote from JLC for pcba, hopefully under 30ish bucks.
  

## 10/23/2025 2 PM - Cost optimizing  

I whipped up a couple BOMS quickly, and got my quotes from jlcpcb!

For the pcba + pcb + shipping it came to $28.30, which is pretty decent (especially for shipping to nz lol). Then I went onto aliexpress and tried to find a bunch of parts. This was a bit more rough :(

I already had my original links (I build a bom as I work on the pcb) but after adding them all it came to like 70NZD (40ish US i think) which wasn't great. I tried to cut down on shipping by optimizing for the 'choice' parts, and I managed to find some cheaper options for some of the parts, but unfortunately, a lot of the cost is just in the shipping. Eventually, I managed to get it down to 60NZD (30ish usd). 

Not terrible, but not amazing either. I'm going to try and hunt some more and see if I can source parts locally instead for footswitches, etc.

![My BOMS](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDYwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--bdb9866a250a8cbf29568401417c6040e726f708/image.png)
My boms, top is ideal, excl. shipping and pcb/pcba costs, so components only, bottom is actual quoted numbers.  

## 10/23/2025 4 PM - Designed top case  

I quickly (-not) made a design for the top case of the enclosure. This is going to be a 2-5 (depending on what i can get) sheet of some form of wood, preferably not plywood. Its going to be cut and engraved with a laser cutter which i've got access to at school. I might also dig a bit out of the actual knob controls with a cnc or dremel to chuck in some glow in the dark paint as well.

Anyway, here's the design I came up with:
![Design](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDYzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ede1820747cf365d894507a963c66325b620405e/image.png)

I think the knobs make some sense:
The top left is step, top middle pulse, top right speed, the bottom left attack, and bottom right release.  

## 11/1/2025 - Re-double checked the circuit  

Given the very large amount of changes I'd made to the circuit since my last breadboarding session, I decided it would probably be good to once again double check that everything still worked (also there were a few issues on the first breadboard I wanted to iron out). After a couple hours and one blown up potentiometer (don't ask how) I am happy to report a resounding success. I constructed the entire vca and envelope generator section, including power supply but skipping over the digital circuitry, and everything (eventually) worked perfectly :)

It took a couple rejiggings of the bias potentiometer and also halving the v-ground to account for the transistor activation current (forgor what its called) so that at 0v cv, it would be at full volume rather than cutting out at around 1v.

Unfortunately my phone is dead and takes hours to charge, so you'll have to cope with webcam photo sorry.

## 11/3/2025 5:22 PM - Re-did the top art  

I decided that actually I hated the current art I'd made for this project, so I decided to draw up a new design. This time I got to showcase a bit more actual artistry (still terrible i know lol) but I'm overall pretty happy with the results, did take a decent amount of time unfortunately, but I'll still try to push through and ship this today.

MORE TOP ART

I realized that I'd forgotten to put the actual name of the pedal on the design, and there was a rather tempting empty spot that looked perfect for it, lo and behold, it was!
